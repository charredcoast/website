                        <strong>Description</strong></br>
                        The place really lives up to its name. Traditional Sindhi Cuisine served at its best. It really packs a punch(Duma Dum) and is absolutely delicious(Mast Kalandar). The ambience is Sindhi themed and is decent. The staff are really cooperative and suggest you their best dishes.

Lets look at what we had:   

Traditional Sindhi Cool Drink: Refreshing and fruity. Fresh watermelon and rose syrup combined with ice cubes.

Pudina Matho: Your very own spiced buttermilk with minty freshness.

Mango Lassi: Really loved this, the mango flavor really comes through in the drink.

Sindhi Tikki: Channa Dal stuffed in alu tikki  and drizzled with a tangy sauce. Absolutely recommended.

Chicken Papad Fry: Papad crumbed chicken deep fried served with chutney. People who love deep fried stuff should really try it.

Lahori Chicken Tikka: The tikka  had a really good smoky flavor to it which made it a very good appetizer.

Stuffed Paneer Sikhanji Tikka: Fresh and tender paneer cubes stuffed with ajwain based filling.

Ghar Jaisa Chicken Makhanwala(with naan): Who doesnt love butter chicken and specially when it is called Ghar ka. Small chicken pieces mixed in a flavorful and desi makhan gravy.

Veg Biryani: The rice was perfectly cooked and had lots of veggies and small cubes of paneer. The spice and the flavors were really well balanced.

Must try*: Traditional Sindhi Cool Drink, Mango Lassi, Sindhi Tikki, Ghar Jaisa Chicken Makhanwala.

New place in Chembur. It is next to Eastern express highway so it`s convenient by road.
The place is a ground plus one structure. They have swings like seatings upsatirs .
.
We started our meal with refreshing watermelon drinks.
Then we ordered tomato with ajwaine soup. I didn`t like the taste of ajwaine in it but my friend loved it.
.
Dal pakwan was one of the bestest starters that I`ve tried in Sindhi cuisine. Loved the Flavours of Dal.
.
Stuffed paneer Tikka was also mouthwatering. The stuffing was of onion and tomato. So the combination was going good.
.
Paneer makhanwala pizza - this flavour was something unique. The taste was little bland as I was expecting that makhanwala taste which was lagging in it.
.
Sev Tikka bhaji and Indian breads are perfect combination for main course. I`ll really recommend this dish.
.
For dessert we ordered falooda which was in the mocktail section because we didn`t want rabri in our falooda. But he bought us rabri falooda without rabri and it was just dry. There was nothing expect those sevaya . Dessert was disappointing because he misinterpreted our order.
.
Overall it was nice place. Viraj</p>
